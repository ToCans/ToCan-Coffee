# ToCan-Coffee

â˜• Introductory Coffee Website

## Introduction:

Centralized Location for getting into coffee. Site includes coffee basics, recipes, brewing equipment, and tools.
Will hopefully start to sell equipment on site at some point (i.e. 3d printed bpa free brewers, japanese ceramic mugs, etc).

## To Do:

### Immmediate:

-   Delete Index.html in basics,equipment,recipes, and tools folders.
-   Move contents to specific part of folders (i.e. move "basics" index.html to a new html in "basics/getting-started".
-   Will then have to change hover effects from <a> to <li>

### Shelf:

-   Add more viewports options.
-   JS for scrolling images.
