# ToCan-Coffee

â˜• Introductory Coffee Website

## Introduction:

Centralized Location for getting into coffee. Site includes coffee basics, recipes, brewing equipment, and tools.
Will hopefully start to sell equipment on site at some point (i.e. 3d printed bpa free brewers, japanese ceramic mugs, etc).

## To Do:

### Immmediate:

-   Add in content for the equipment, recipes, and tools files
-   Will have to change hover effects from anchors to list items. Fix broken anchor links too.
-   Start Adding content.

### Shelf:

-   JS for scrolling images.
-   Start storing grinder ratios
